	abstract = {{AbstractNuclear} Magnetic Resonance ({NMR}) relaxation is a powerful technique that provides information about internal dynamics associated with configurational energetics in proteins, as well as site-specific information involved in conformational equilibria. In particular, 15N relaxation is a useful probe to characterize overall and internal backbone dynamics of proteins because the relaxation mainly reflects reorientational motion of the N–H bond vector. Over the past 20 years, experiments and protocols for analysis of 15N R 1, R 2, and the heteronuclear 15N–\{1H\} {NOE} data have been well established. The development of these methods has kept pace with the increase in the available static–magnetic field strength, providing dynamic parameters optimized from data fitting at multiple field strengths. Using these methodological advances, correlation times for global tumbling and order parameters and correlation times for internal motions of many proteins have been determined. More recently, transverse relaxation dispersion experiments have extended the range of {NMR} relaxation studies to the milli- to microsecond time scale, and have provided quantitative information about functional conformational exchange in proteins. Here, we present an overview of recent advances in 15N relaxation experiments to characterize protein backbone dynamics.Graphical Abstract Open image in new window},

Nuclear magnetic spin relaxation uniquely depends on both spatial and temporal fluctuations of nuclear spin interactions and enables structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic descriptions of complex dynamical processes in biological macromolecules.

	abstract = {In the case of soluble proteins, chemical shift mapping is used to identify the intermolecular interfaces when the {NOE}-based calculations of spatial structure of the molecular assembly are impossible or impracticable. However, the reliability of the membrane protein interface mapping based on chemical shifts or other relevant parameters was never assessed. In the present work, we investigate the predictive power of various {NMR} parameters that can be used for mapping of helix-helix interfaces in dimeric {TM} domains. These parameters are studied on a dataset containing three structures of helical dimers obtained for two different proteins in various membrane mimetics. We conclude that the amide chemical shifts have very little predictive value, while the methyl chemical shifts could be used to predict interfaces, though with great care. We suggest an approach based on conversion of the carbon {NMR} relaxation parameters of methyl groups into parameters of motion, and one of such values, the characteristic time of methyl rotation, appears to be a reliable sensor of interhelix contacts in transmembrane domains. The carbon {NMR} relaxation parameters of methyl groups can be measured accurately and with high sensitivity and resolution, making the proposed parameter a useful tool for investigation of protein-protein interfaces even in large membrane proteins. An approach to build the models of transmembrane dimers based on perturbations of methyl parameters and {TMDOCK} software is suggested.},

It is found that higher mobility is present in the α helices forming the heme pocket. On the contrary, the β strands, which form the hydrophobic core of the molecule, have the lowest mobility.

Most such studies deal only with ligands and receptor models; however, for many ligand/receptor systems the membrane environment may affect ligand binding. In this work we focused on binding of short-chain alpha-neurotoxin {II} ({NTII}) from Naja oxiana to the native-like lipid bilayer, and the possible role played by the membrane in delivering the toxin to {nAChR}. Experimental ({NMR} and mutagenesis) and molecular modeling (molecular-dynamics simulation) studies revealed a specific interaction of the toxin molecule with the phosphatidylserine headgroup of lipids, resulting in the proper topology of {NTII} on lipid bilayers favoring the attack of {nAChR}. Analysis of short-chain alpha-neurotoxins showed that most of them possess a high positive charge and sequence homology in the lipid-binding motif of {NTII}, implying that interaction with the membrane surrounding {nAChR} may be common for the toxin family.},

	abstract = {Herein we describe the program {FAST}-Modelfree for the fully automated, high throughput analysis of {NMR} spin-relaxation data. This program interfaces with the program Modelfree 4.1 and provides an intuitive graphical user interface for configuration as well as complete standalone operation during the model selection and rotational diffusion parameter optimization processes. {FAST}-Modelfree is also capable of iteratively assigning models to each spin and optimizing the parameters that describe the diffusion tensor. Tests with the protein Ribonuclease A indicate that using this iterative approach even poor initial estimates of the diffusion tensor parameters will converge to the optimal value within a few iterations. In addition to improving the quality of the final fit, this represents a substantial timesaving compared to manual data analysis and minimizes the chance of human error. It is anticipated that this program will be particularly useful for the analysis and comparison of data collected under different conditions such as multiple temperatures and the presence and absence of ligands. Further, this program is intended to establish a more uniform protocol for {NMR} spin-relaxation data analysis, facilitating the comparison of results both between and within research laboratories. Results obtained with {FAST}-Modelfree are compared with previous literature results for the proteins Ribonuclease H, E. coli glutaredoxin-1 and the Ca(2+)-binding protein S100B. These proteins represent data sets collected at both single and multiple static magnetic fields and which required analysis with both isotropic and axially symmetric rotational diffusion tensors. In all cases results obtained with {FAST}-Modelfree compared favorably with the original literature results.},

The first method, requiring 15N, 13C, ∼50\% 2H-labeled protein, measures 2H T1 and T1ρ spin relaxation times at side-chain positions. A second experiment permits the straightforward measurement of 13C1H dipole-dipole cross-correlation relaxation rates at 13Cβ positions in 15N,13C-labeled molecules. An excellent correlation is observed between order parameters, describing the amplitude of motion at these sites, obtained on the basis of 2H relaxation and dipole-dipole cross-correlation relaxation rates. Together these experiments provide a powerful approach for selecting appropriate motional models. The methods are applied to study the side-chain motional properties of the N-terminal {SH}3 domain from the signaling protein drk.},

	abstract = {An arbitrary multiexponential representation of the H−X bond reorientation autocorrelation function is shown to provide robust predictions of both the fast limit (Sf 2) and generalized (S2) order parameters for macromolecular {NMR} relaxation analysis. This representation is applied to the analysis of side-chain dynamics in Escherichia coli thioredoxin to assess correlated torsional fluctuations and the resultant configurational entropy effects. For both the high S2 phenylalanine and low S2 leucine side chains, torsional fluctuations in the major rotamer conformation can predict the observed relaxation data only if main-chain−side-chain torsional correlations are assumed. Crankshaft-like correlations occur around the side-chain χ2 rotation axis and the parallel main-chain rotation axis. For the sterically hindered buried side chains, torsional fluctuations are predicted to be attenuated for the main-chain rotation axis oriented gauche to the χ2 rotation axis. Weaker main-chain−side-chain torsional correlations appear to be present for the highly solvated mobile side chains as well. For these residues, the fast limit order parameter is interpretable in terms of fluctuations within a rotamer state, while the decrease in the order parameter due to motion near the Larmor frequencies can be used to estimate the entropy of rotamer exchange.},

	abstract = {{NMR} relaxation analysis was used to characterize the internal dynamics of oxidized E. coli thioredoxin in both the picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond frequency ranges for 413 H−C and H−N bond vectors. The 13C relaxation data was obtained utilizing protein samples possessing an alternating 13C−12C−13C... labeling pattern for most enriched sites. When combined with partial deuteration, this labeling pattern provides for isolated 1H−13C {IS} spin pairs exhibiting dynamically interpretable relaxation behavior. Side chains were found to exhibit a far broader range of dynamics than have been previously characterized for main chain resonances. The dynamics of structurally buried aromatic and leucine side chains are interpreted in terms of correlated main chain-side chain torsional oscillations. Structural regions exhibiting millisecond dynamics were found to correlate strongly with the presence of side chain-main chain or bifurcated main chain hydrogen bonds. Nuclei around the active site disulfide that exhibit mobility in the millisecond range correspond closely to the set of nuclei whose chemical shifts are altered upon reduction. The transient conformation is interpreted in terms of enhanced reactivity due to strain at the disulfide linkage.},

The average radio-frequency amplitude required is modest compared to other techniques.

	abstract = {A theoretical treatment is given of the general problem of designing amplitude-modulated radiofrequency pulses that will excite a specified band of frequencies within a high-resolution {NMR} spectrum with uniform intensity and phase but with negligible excitation elsewhere. First a trial pulse envelope is defined in terms of a finite Fourier series and its frequency-domain profile calculated through the Bloch equations. The result is compared with the desired target profile to give a multidimensional error surface. The method of simulated annealing is then used to find the global minimum on this surface and the result refined by standard gradient-descent optimization. In this manner, a family of new shaped radio-frequency pulses, known as {BURP} (band-selective, uniform response, pure-phase) pulses, has been created. These are of two classespulses that excite or invert z magnetization and those that act as general-rotation ?r/2 or ? pulses irrespective of the initial condition of the nuclear magnetization. It was found convenient to design the latter class as amplitude-modulated time-symmetric pulses. Tables of Fourier coefficients and pulse-shape ordinates are given for practical implementation of {BURP} pulses, together with the calculated frequency-domain responses and experimental verifications. Examples of the application of band-selective pulses in conventional and multidimensional spectroscopy are given. Pure-phase pulses of this type should also find applications in magnetic resonance imaging where refocusing schemes are undesirable.},

	abstract = {New amplitude-modulated radiofrequency pulses are proposed that allow one to achieve selective excitation, de-excitation, inversion, and refocusing of spin-12 systems in {NMR}. The rotation angles and axes are well defined over a chosen bandwidth, regardless of the initial conditions. These universal pulses are derived from the idea of Gaussian pulse cascades, but their design is guided by new principles. The amplitude profiles are optimized by calculating the quaternions representing the propagators of the overall rotations as a function of offset. This procedure provides a more general approach to pulse design than the usual optimization of the response to some initial condition.},

	abstract = {Band-selective radiofrequency (rf) pulses provide powerful spectroscopic tools for many biomolecular {NMR} applications. Band-selectivity is commonly achieved by pulse shaping where the rf amplitude and phase are modulated according to a numerically optimized function. This results in complex spin evolution trajectories during the pulse duration. Here we introduce simplified representations of a number of shaped pulses, commonly used in biomolecular {NMR} spectroscopy. These simple schemes, consisting in a suite of free evolution delays and ideal rf pulses, reproduce astonishingly well the effect on a scalar-coupled hetero-nuclear two-spin system. As a consequence, optimal use of such pulse shapes in complex multi-pulse sequences becomes straightforward, as demonstrated here for the example of longitudinal-relaxation-enhanced {BEST}-{HSQC} and {BEST}-{TROSY} experiments. Applications of these optimized pulse sequences to several proteins in the size range of 821kDa are shown.},

Dipole-dipole cross-correlated relaxation effects in T1 experiments were suppressed by the combination of radio-frequency pulses and pulsed field gradients during the relaxation delay leading to monoexponential relaxation decays that allow a more accurate extraction of the 13C T1 relaxation times. Heteronuclear 1H-13C {NOEs} obtained by using different proton saturation schemes indicate that the influence of cross-correlation is small. The experimental T1 and {NOE} data were interpreted in a model-free way in terms of a generalized order parameter and an internal correlation time.},

	abstract = {A large fraction of hydrogens in proteins and nucleic acids is of the methylene type. Their detailed study, however, in terms of structure and dynamics by {NMR} spectroscopy is hampered by their fast relaxation properties, which give rise to low sensitivity and resolution. It is demonstrated that six different relaxation interference processes, involving 1H?13C and 1H?1H dipolar interactions and 1H and 13C chemical shift anisotropy, can be used simultaneously to mitigate these problems effectively. The approach is applicable to the majority of {NMR} experiments commonly used to study side chain and backbone conformation. For proteins, its efficiency is evaluated quantitatively for two samples:? the third {IgG}-binding domain from Streptococcal Protein G and the protein calmodulin complexed with a 26-residue target peptide. Gains in both resolution and sensitivity by up to factors of 3.2 and 2.0, respectively, are observed for Gly residues at high magnetic field strengths, but even at much lower fields gains remain substantial. The resolution enhancement obtained for methylene groups makes possible a detailed analysis of spectral regions commonly considered inaccessible due to spectral crowding. For {DNA}, the high resolution now obtainable for C5 sites permits an H5/H5?-based sequential {NOE} assignment procedure, complementary to the conventional base-H1/H2/H2? pathway.},
